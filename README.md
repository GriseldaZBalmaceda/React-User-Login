# User-Login
This may seem like a simple user login in but it is jam packed with some high level react concepts. This user login demonstrates how we can use Reacts Hooks like useEffect and  useReducer to handle side effects and state changes more efficiently. We also tackle Reacts Context API to avoid prop chain issues. We also dove into refs and using 
React.forwardRef to allow us to use refs in functional components.
